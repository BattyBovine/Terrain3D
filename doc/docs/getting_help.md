Getting Help
===================

**Read the docs**: Many questions have already been addressed in this documentation, especially in [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and [Setting Up Textures](texture_prep.md).

**Discord**: For questions or technical issues, join the [Tokisan discord server](https://tokisan.com/discord) and ask in the #terrain-help channel.

**Issues**: For technical issues or bug reports, search through the [issues](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D/issues) to ensure it hasn't already been reported, then create a new one. Use discord for questions.

Be ready to provide [logs](troubleshooting.md#debug-logs) and information about your system, versions used, the exact steps you tried, and the results of those steps. We can't help you with vague information.
